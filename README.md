![Walmart Banner](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Walmart_logo.svg/2560px-Walmart_logo.svg.png)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Walmart's **weekly sales data (2010–2012)** to uncover insights into:

- Overall sales performance  
- Top-performing stores  
- Holiday vs. non-holiday impact  
- Economic trends (CPI, Unemployment)  
- Actionable business strategies to boost revenue  

It simulates a real-world data analytics task where a company wants to improve sales performance using historical data.

## Objectives

- Identify trends and patterns in sales  
- Find top-performing and underperforming stores  
- Analyze holiday sales impact  
- Understand how economic indicators (like CPI & unemployment) affect sales  
- Recommend data-driven strategies for revenue growth

## Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Data analysis & visualization |
| `pandas` | Data cleaning, manipulation |
| `matplotlib`, `seaborn` | Exploratory data visualization |
| `datetime` | Time-based analysis |
| **Google Colab** | Cloud-based notebook environment |

## Key Findings

### 1. Sales Trends
- Seasonal sales spikes occur near specific months, especially around holidays.
- No major long-term increase or decline from 2010–2012.

### 2. Top-Performing Stores
- Stores **#20, #4, and #14** consistently generate the highest revenue.
- Top stores account for a disproportionately high share of total sales.

### 3. Holiday Sales Insights
- **95% of revenue** is from **non-holiday weeks**.
- Holidays do **not significantly boost sales**, revealing an untapped marketing opportunity.

### 4. Economic Factors
- Slight positive correlation between **unemployment** and **sales**.
- Suggests price-sensitive consumers prefer Walmart during economic downturns.

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Replicate top store strategies** (location, promotions, customer experience) across low-performing stores.
- **Boost holiday campaigns** with stronger marketing, time-limited deals, and seasonal bundles.
- **Expand value-based product lines** to attract budget-conscious customers during economic instability.
- **Optimize inventory planning** using time series patterns to avoid overstocking/understocking.
